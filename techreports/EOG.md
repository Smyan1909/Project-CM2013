EOG: <emph>e</emph>lectro<emph>o</emph>culo<emph>g</emph>raphy
==============================================================

1 Introduction and background information: what is electrooculography and how it is approached in literature
-----------------------------------------

2 Challenges specific to the signal samples we have
---------------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Gross artefacts of disconnection and saturation
The EOG signals that we got appear to be mostly unfiltered, apart from presumably some analog prefilters. Artefact regions are definitely present and they are apparently not annotated.

Probably the most obvious artefacts are those caused by poor electrode contact or complete disconnection, which appear as large
